# PicturesChatWebsite

This simple website allows its users to chat with each other using pictures only, which adds some new experience to basic communication. 
The website uses PHP for data processing, MySQL for data storage and Bootstrap with CSS for pages' style.

The project was finished in 2021, as a state of prototype.
